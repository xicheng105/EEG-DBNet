# EEG-DBNet

This is just a temporary repository, and we haven't had the time to perfect it yet. However, this does not affect the normal operation of the files. The files Main.py and Preprocessing.py are modified based on the following repository: 

https://github.com/Altaheri/EEG-ATCNet, 

with additional datasets and preprocessing methods added.

The datasets used in this project (BCI Competition 2a and 2b) were downloaded from: 

https://bnci-horizon-2020.eu/database/data-sets.

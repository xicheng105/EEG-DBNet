# EEG-DBNet

This is just a temporary repository; we haven't perfected it yet. However, this does not affect the file's operation. The files main.py and preprocessing.py are modified based on the following repository: 

<https://github.com/Altaheri/EEG-ATCNet>, 

with additional datasets and preprocessing methods added.
<br/>
<br/>
The datasets used in this project (BCI Competition 2a and 2b) were downloaded from:
